# sqlalchemy-challenge

Welcome to the SQLAlchemy Challenge repository! This project demonstrates how to use SQLAlchemy to interact with a database, retrieve data, and visualize results using Python. The repository contains scripts for querying precipitation data and other weather-related datasets, as well as creating visualizations with Matplotlib.

# Project Overview

This project is part of a broader effort to explore data analysis and web development using Python. It includes:

Querying data from a SQLite database using SQLAlchemy.

Performing data analysis and transformation using Pandas.

Creating visualizations of weather data with Matplotlib.

Future integration with a Flask web application (TBD).

# Repository Contents

climate_analysis.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the querying and analysis of weather data.

app.py (TBD): A Flask application for serving the analyzed data and visualizations through a web interface.

Resources/: Contains the SQLite database (hawaii.sqlite) used in the project.

Images/: A directory for saving visualizations generated during the analysis.


# Running the Analysis

Open the climate_analysis.ipynb notebook in Jupyter:

jupyter notebook climate_analysis.ipynb

Follow the steps in the notebook to query the database, analyze the data, and create visualizations.

# Future Development

Flask Integration: A Flask web application will be added to serve the analysis results and visualizations via a web interface.

Enhanced Visualizations: Additional plots and interactive charts may be included to further explore the dataset.
